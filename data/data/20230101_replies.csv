If you earn bitcoin once, you don't need to earn buying power again by investing it. On the other hand, with fiat currencies, you literally have to earn your money twice - once by working for it, and the second time by investing."

In my opinion it solves the wealth gap between the rich and poor, which exists because of financial illiteracy. If you don't understand money, you get screwed by fiat currencies.
