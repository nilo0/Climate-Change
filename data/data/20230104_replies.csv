Look at 2017/18 and 2018/19. 2018/19 the water flow was only 25% of the previous year. The long-term trend might go up but if there are several drought years in a row Kariba isn't filling up.

The Kariba North Bank generating capacity was expanded from 720 MW to 1080 MW in 2010. Similar expansion was done on the South Bank. This would have led to (50%?) more water consumption than previously. This must be a contributing factor to low water levels.

Some rainy seasons are shorter than others so the area under the graph of flow rate vs time may vary due to season duration. The maximum flow should be a good proxy for total flow.
